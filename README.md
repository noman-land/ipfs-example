## IPFS Example

This is a simple example of starting an IPFS node inside a node or browser project. Any data added to IPFS will be retrievable from any public gateway. 

### Steps to run

1. Clone the repo:

    git clone
    
2. Navigate to project folder:

    cd ipfs-example;
    
3. Install dependencies:

    npm install;
    
4. Start project:

    npm start;
    
    You will see the example json added to IPFS and the result will be logged. The hash can be tested on a public gateway to confirm that it has been added to IPFS:
